You've heard the talks, you've drunk the beer - now, own the app!

Find out the latest deets from your iOS BFFs in Manx. Within the tiny and unassuming confines of this software application, you will be amazed with news of the latest talks, thrilled by the info about upcoming meetups, and stunned by the social media integration! And, with the amazing mapping feature, you'll never find yourself lost walking lonely through the Northern Quarter in just your skivvies  in the dark again. Unless you're into that.

## No, Really, What's This About

This is the main repo for the [NSManchester](http://www.meetup.com/NSManchester/) iOS application, soon to be available from all good App Stores near you. Please send pull requests to contribute code and help crafting new features and awesome experiences.

This application is as much a learning project for using Swift as it is an _awesome_ application, so feel free to use whichever new fancy API's or syntax you want. We're all here to learn!
